## Responsibilities:
Michelle - to do Tableau stuff, ppt.
Colin - Frontend/backend

## Requirements:
1. Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing.
2. Use ML in the context of technologies learned.
3. You must use: Scikit-Learn and/or another machine learning library.
4. You must use at least two of the below:
* Python Pandas
* Python Matplotlib
* HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
* **JavaScript Plotly**
* JavaScript D3.js
* JavaScript Leaflet
* SQL Database
* MongoDB Database
* Google Cloud SQL
* Amazon AWS
* **Tableau**
5. Host application using Heroku or a tool of your choicen (**Github pages**, Flask).
6. Prepare a 15-minute data deep-dive or infrastructure walkthrough that shows
machine learning in the context of what we’ve already learned.
Final Project Requirements: Demystifying ML
7. Example projects:
* Create a front-end interface that maps to an API to “smarten” the algorithm.
* Perform a deep dive of existing data using machine learning.
* Create a visualization that continues to learn where clusters lie based on ML.
(Use D3 or Plotly to change the visualization.)
* Create an idea with mock data that simulates how machine learning might be used.
* Create an analysis of existing data to make a prediction, classification, or regression.
